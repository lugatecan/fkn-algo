1. Reading: Framework for learning Data Structurea and Algorithms: 
	Questions from Part1:  
		a. What are binary search trees (BST), AVL trees, red-black trees, interval trees, B-trees and how do they relate to linked lists?
		b. Difference bween Graphs / Hashtables(both adjancy tables and adjacency Matrices), heaps(based on arrays) vs treesbased on (based on lists)?
	Good Points from Part 2:  
		a. "There are many kinds of data structures, but their purpose is to add, delete, search and modify them as efficiently as possible"
		b. Tranverse and Access: Linear is represented by for / while iteration, and nonlinear is represented by recursion
